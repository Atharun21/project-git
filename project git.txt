 Clone the Repository
First, clone the provided repository and set up the quiz bot as per the instructions given in the repository.

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/impressai/quiz-bot.git
cd quiz-bot
# Follow the setup instructions provided in the repository's README file
Step 2: Complete record_current_answer Function
In core/reply_factory.py, locate the record_current_answer function. This function is responsible for validating and storing the user's answers.

Here's a general approach:

Validate the Answer: Check if the user's answer is valid (e.g., it's within the range of acceptable answers).
Store the Answer: Record the answer in the user's session or a database.
python
Copy code
def record_current_answer(user_session, answer):
    # Assuming questions and answers are stored in user_session
    current_question = user_session.get('current_question')
    
    if current_question is not None:
        # Validate the answer (assuming answers are indexed from 0)
        if answer in range(len(current_question['options'])):
            user_session['answers'].append(answer)
            return True
        else:
            return False
    return False
Step 3: Implement get_next_question Function
This function should fetch the next question to present to the user. You'll likely need to track the current question index in the user's session.

python
Copy code
def get_next_question(user_session):
    # Assuming questions are stored in user_session
    questions = user_session.get('questions')
    current_index = user_session.get('current_index', 0)
    
    if current_index < len(questions):
        user_session['current_question'] = questions[current_index]
        user_session['current_index'] = current_index + 1
        return questions[current_index]
    else:
        return None
Step 4: Complete generate_final_response Function
This function should calculate the user's score and provide a summary of their performance.

python
Copy code
def generate_final_response(user_session):
    questions = user_session.get('questions')
    answers = user_session.get('answers')
    
    if not questions or not answers:
        return "No quiz data available."
    
    score = sum(1 for q, a in zip(questions, answers) if q['correct_option'] == a)
    total_questions = len(questions)
    
    return f"You scored {score} out of {total_questions}."
Step 5: Test the Code Changes
Run the quiz bot and interact with it to ensure it works as expected. The bot should ask all questions, record answers, and provide a final score.
